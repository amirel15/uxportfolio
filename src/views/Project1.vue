            <b>The Product:</b> MetroU Hospital is an institution that has been around since the early 2000s. It is the go to place in the
            metropolitan area for all your medical needs from routine to emergency.
            <br/><b>Project Duration:</b> January 2023 - May 2023
            <br/><b>The Problem:</b> Hospital employees have to use an internet browser on a desktop or go in person to find
            out work schedule or find other employee information.
            <br/><b>The Goal:</b> Develop a mobile applicaiton that will solve the mentioned problem all in the palm of your hand.
            <br/><b>My Role:</b> UX Designer
            <br/><b>Responsibilities:</b> user research, wireframing, prototyping<br/>

            <b>Summary</b>
            <br/>I conducted research by use of questionnaires and surveys amongst employees throughout the hospital to find out how they
            felt about always having to call the hospital or come in on their day off to find out about the schedule. I noticed one of the
            main departments that had issues was the pediatric surgical department. Based off what was discovered in the research findings,
            individuals who participated in multiple departments sometimes had trouble finding information about if they had coverage or staffing.
            <br/><br/><b>Pain Points</b>
            <br/><b>Time:</b>  Working adults dont always have time to stop what they are doing to find a desktop to view what they need.
            <br/><b>Accessibility:</b>  Not everyone always has a desktop in front of them 24/7. There are only limited ways at the moment to
            access needed information.
            <br/><b>Information Being in Multiple Places:</b>  Schedule is in one place while the contact information of the staff is in other.
            Adds more duties one has to do than needed.

            <b>Persona 1</b>
            <br/><b>Name:</b> Jeffery
            <br/><i>“I am all about helping others. In order to help them, I must first take care of myself. I love the quiet I find in nature and use it as a way to
            decompress after a long week.”</i>
            <br/><br/><b>About</b>
            <br/>He is a 25 year old male living in Austin, TX. He currently has a Bachelor's degree in Nursing and works as an ICU Nurse.
            <br/>Jeffery is an ICU nurse with a very busy and hectic schedule. They work in the Cardiac ICU of a major metropolitan hospital. On their free time, they enjoy
            hiking and exploring nature. Since they work in a very busy hospital, ensuring there is always coverage is important. Jeffery would like an easier to navigate
            scheduling application to ensure the rest of his team is playing to their strengths, especially at peak times.
            <br/><br/><b>Goals:</b>
            <br/>-To be what their patients need when they need it
            <br/>-To balance a healthy relationship between work & personal life
            <br/>-To find a smoother transition when it comes to shift changes to benefit both employees & patients
            <br/><br/><b>Frustrations:</b>
            <br/>“Being short staffed on the floor due to scheduling errors makes more unnecessary work.”
            <br/>“If the scheduling app allowed for me to see Cardiac Departments shifts, I could make a more efficient schedule.”

            <br/><br/><b>Persona2</b>
            <br/><b>Name:</b> Alex
            <br/><i>“Ever since having a child, I have learned how precious time can be. Whenever I am not at work, I try to make
            the best of it and make memories with my little one.”</i>
            <br/><br/><b>About</b>
            <br/>He is a 38 year old male from Nashville, TN. He currently has a PhD and MD degree and works as a Pediartic Suregon.
            <br/>Alex has been a pediatric surgeon for about a decade. They used to work at a small hospital that didnt handle as many
            patients as their current hospital does. They are still getting used to the demand and how often scheduling can be affected
            due to an emergency. They dont let this bother them. They are just trying to make it work to where they can still get home
            in time to tuck in their child whenever possible.
            <br/><br/><b>Goals:</b>
            <br/>-To make every patient feel a little better after surgery
            <br/>-To try & do the minimally invasive surgery possible to make the childs recovery quicker & smoother
            <br/>-To try to make it home at a decent hour when not on call to spend time with family instead of in an OR
            <br/><br/><b>Frustrations:</b>
            <br/>“Sometimes staff scheduling issues in other departments cause me to have to postpone or delay my patient's surgeries.”
            <br/>“Sometimes I wish I could be made known somehow that my scheduled non emergent surgeries had the staff needed scheduled.”

    <div class="prototypes">
        <div class="prtitle">Usability Study: Findings</div>
        <div class="prfind">            
            <br/>I conducted a few studies. Findings from the first study helped me decide to shrink down the population field before expanding
            to more areas in the hospital. This is because different departments have different responsibilities and areas needed for access.
            Individuals in the second study used a high fidelity prototype and recommended adding more color and removing repeated words.
            <br/><br/><b>Round 1 Findings</b>
            <br/>-Users want an app relevant to their department
            <br/>-Users wanted a menu option instead of having to go back to home page every time
            <br/><br/><b>Round 2 Findings</b>
            <br/>-Users wanted more color to help differentiate objects on screen
            <br/>-Users felt some words on screen were repetitive which caused confusion
            <br/><br/><b>Accessibility Considerations</b>
            <br/>-Added extra screens to eliminate clutter
            <br/>-Added color to make it easier to differentiate objects or icons on screen
            <br/>-Tried to add as little as needed of necessary text to avoid confusion and clutter

            <br/><b>Impact</b>
            <br/>I implemented this design towards another department in the hospital before combining the two and slow expand until
            as much of the hospital departments and employees are included and have access.
            <br/><br/><b>What I Learned</b>
            <br/>I learned to not start off too big at the beginning. W h ile the goal for this application to for a whole
            institution, starting small with just one department helped me better listen to the needs of the users and make the process easier in the future.
        </div>
        <div class="next">
            <br/><b>Next Steps</b>
            <br/>-Conduct one more study with the necessary changes made and implemented before expanding applicaiton larger.
            <br/>-Repeat same process with the next department.
            <br/>-Hopefully be able to combine the two departments with one functional application.
