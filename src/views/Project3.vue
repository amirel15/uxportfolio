        <div class="pbody">
            <br/><b>The Product:</b> The Lets Make Kids Meals application is a product of KidsUp Co. This company focuses on trying to
            make kids more able-bodied to real world experiences. KidsUp Co. offers programs, applications, and utilities that help
            a child become more independent and ready them for when they are older.            
            <br/><b>Project Duration:</b> January 2023 - May 2023
            <br/><b>The Problem:</b> Growing up, not all perople are exposed to skills and experiences that they will need when they
            are older. Some individuals dont start learning how to cook until they are in their 20s, and that is because they are forced to.
            <br/><b>The Goal:</b>  This application helps kids, from their young years to their teen years, learn how to make recipes in
            their very own kitchen. It offers meals from breakfast and dinner to snacks.
            <br/><b>My Role:</b> UX Designer, UX Researcher
            <br/><b>Responsibilities:</b> develop a kid-friendly app that kids of all ages can maneuver, execute surveys and trial runs with
            potential users to better the application<br/>

            <b>Summary</b>
            <br/>We conducted research by taking surveys and questionaries from kids who ages 5 to 18. We asked them a series of questions to see
            how much they knew about cooking, how experienced they were, how they learned how to cook, and how do they feel about recipe apps.
            The older individuals who were surveyed seem to all a similar consensus that they wished more recipe apps had simpler recipes to work
            with. They had the desire to want to learn how to cook for themselves or their families, but some recipes felt “too complex or challenging”.
            The individuals, from various age groups, that did not have phone access yet did have access to a tablet or desktop. This provided insight
            for us to develop a mobile app more configured for tablet screens than phone screens because it allowed for more space, less clutter, and
            to include more youngsters to use the application.

        <div class="prfind">            
            <br/><b>Study Type:</b> Unmoderated usability study
            <br/><b>Location:</b> Texas, USA, Remote
            <br/><b>Participants:</b> 15 participants ages 5 to 18 (those who need assistance received it from their parents)
            <br/><b>Length:</b> 15 minutes to 1 hour (depending on their reading ability)
            <br/><br/><b>Findings</b>
            <br/>-It was very detailed, so those able to read were able to understand the recipe well. However, those without strong reading skills felt discouraged
            to want to attempt recipe.
            <br/>-Participants or parents of participants that needed assistance felt that a disclosure should be added somewhereas a precaution because knives and
            the stove/oven are used.
            <br/>-Younger participants voiced they would like pictures added to help identiy ingredients so they could be of more assistance when making the recipe.
            <br/><br/><b>Accessibility Considerations</b>
            <br/>-Add pictures of ingredients to help better identify what ingredients are needed for the recipe.
            <br/>-Separated the ingredients and instructions of each recipe into two different pages to declutter application.

            <br/><b>Impact</b>
            <br/>After following recommendations from out study participants, we were able to redesign and make an application that allows for youngsters of all ages
            to be able to navigate and helps them further their desires in the kitchen.

            <br/><br/><b>What I Learned</b>
            <br/>I learned is listen to your users. They’ll be the ones making most use of the application and you want them coming back for more. They helped me
            realize to start off small and to be able to listen to each of their concerns and recommendations to get a stable simple application before expanding to
            something larger.

        </div>
        <div class="next">
            <br/><b>Next Steps</b>
            <br/>-Add more recipes for each mealtime.
            <br/>-Maybe consider breaking down each mealtime a little more once more recipes are added to make it easier for users to decide which recipe they want to
            try based on difficulty and complexity.
            <br/>-Maybe add a page that allows users that aren’t part of the initial studies to make recommendations to better the application or for adding certain
            recipes they have interest in.
